### About This Project
This webapp uses GraphQL queries to pull data from an api and Apollo to handle the data. The new data is stored into the applications initial store state, and distributed using Redux-Sagas. From there it is placed in a Plotly.js line graph giving a real-time visual representation of the data every 1.3 seconds.
